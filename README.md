## Description & General Info
This project randomly selects a peice of advice from an array of sewing tips and prints it to the console. This code was created to fufill the "Mixed Messages" portfolio project in Codecademy's Full Stack Engineer course.

## Languages & Technologies
- JavaScript
- Node.js

## Setup & Use
1. Make sure you have Node installed on your computer. If not, download it from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org).
2. Download or clone this repository onto your computer
3. navigate (`cd`) into directory where you have saved the Javascript file from your terminal
4. type `node sewingtips.js` into the command line and hit enter
5. A random sewing tip will be printed on your terminal!
 

## Suggestions for Improvements
- While this project is originally intended to make use of Node, future improvements could include adding an HTML and CSS file so that the functionality of sewingtips.js could be accessed on a browser, perhaps by clicking a button to display the tip. 
- Another feature that could be added is to have an input box for users to select a type of fabric and then add functionality so that the random fact that is returned is selected from a corresponding array that matches the fabric type selected.
